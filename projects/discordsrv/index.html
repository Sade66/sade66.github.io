    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Using this plugin, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game to chat with players on your Discord server as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people on the server. This is useful for the situation of someone not being at their computer and being able to talk in-game.</p>
    <p>As well as that, this plugin also has a remote console feature. You can designate a text channel for the plugin to listen on where messages sent to that channel are run as commands by the server console. You should restrict sending this channel to a developer or high ranking role only. Due to how Discord's permissions work, though, you can have some server roles being able to see the console, yet not being able to send messages in that channel, thus creating a read-only console for trusted staff members.</p>
    <p>Both the chat and console link are toggleable through the configuration file. Some, but not all, options can be refreshed with <u>/discord reload</u>, by an op. VanishNoPacket permissions like silent join/quit, fake join/quit and join without announcing are checked when sending player join messages in the chat channel.</p>
