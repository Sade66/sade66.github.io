  <div class="info" id="usage">
    <h2>Intended Usage</h2>
    <p>Using this plugin, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game to chat with players on your Discord server as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people on the server- this is useful for the situation of someone not being at their computer and being able to talk in-game.</p>
    <p>As well as that, this plugin also has a remote console feature. You can designate a text channel for the plugin to listen on where messages sent to that channel are run as commands by the server console. You should restrict sending this channel to a developer or high ranking role only. Due to how Discord's permissions work, though, you can have some server roles being able to see the console, yet not being able to send messages in that channel, thus creating a read-only console for trusted staff members.</p>
    <p>Both the chat and console link are toggleable through the configuration file. Some, but not all, options can be refreshed with /discord reload, by an op. VanishNoPacket permissions like silent join/quit, fake join/quit and join without announcing are checked when sending player join messages in the chat channel.</p>

    <h2>Supported Plugins</h2>
    <p>DiscordSRV implements with a fair amount of plugins for chat and vanish functionality. We recommend <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/venturechat.771/">VentureChat by Aust1n46</a> but plugins such as Herochat, VentureChat, Essentials, Premium/Super vanish, VanishNoPacket, and Multiverse all have functionality in DiscordSRV.</p>

  <div class="info" id="perms">
    <h2>Commands / Permissions</h2>
    <h3>/discord</h3>
    <p>All of DiscordSRV's commands can be exposed from /discord. This includes but isn't limited to /discord toggle which toggles sending Discord messages back/forth for you- tell your players about this command!</p>
    <h3>discordsrv.chat</h3>
    <p>Allows people to have their chat sent to Discord. Go figure. Given by default, only exists so you can negate this permission from people/groups.</p>
    <h3>OP</h3>
    <p>All the admin commands for DiscordSRV require you to be an OP. To see the help, run /discordsrv in-game.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info" id="faq">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>How do I fix the error "Unsupported major.minor version 52.0?"</h3>
    <p>Update the server's Java JRE version to Java 8. <1.8 is unsupported.</p>
    <h3>I reloaded the plugin/server and now it won't work</h3>
    <p>DON'T RELOAD THE PLUGIN</p>
    <h3>When I join/quit my server, a message isn't sent in the chat channel for me. What gives?</h3>
    <p>You have one of VanishNoPacket's/Essentials' permissions to join/quit silently. To disallow this, give yourself or the group one of the following depending on what you want to allow.</p>
    <div class="code" id="vanishCode">
      <p> -vanish.<span>silentjoin</span></p>
      <p> -vanish.<span>joinwithoutannounce</span></p>
      <p> -vanish.<span>silentquit</span></p>
      <p> -essentials.<span>silentjoin</span></p>
      <p> -essentials.<span>silentquit</span><p>

    <h2>Developers</h2>
    <p>If you want to interface DiscordSRV with your plugin, you can do so by adding the Maven dependency or adding the plugin jar (11+) to your project, extending DiscordSRVListener, then overriding the methods in it. For an example of this, see <a href="https://github.com/Scarsz/DiscordSRV-ApiTest">https://github.com/Scarsz/DiscordSRV-ApiTest</a>. Be sure to add "DiscordSRV" to your plugin's plugin.yml depends or softdepends list.</p>
