      <h1>Introducing <strong>Project Lunch-Box</strong></h1>
      <h2><em>An event in the spirit of Jampacked, made for the community by the community.</em></h2>
      <p>Jampacked has in the past brought us some truly amazing modpacks and it’s been an amazing event that’s pushed the very limits of creativity within the community to its max. However the driving force behind Jampacked has recently been put to a grinding halt and the event as a whole has been stagnant with no hope of future continuation.</p>
      <p>Therefore our team consisting of old Jampacked “staff” and new people within the community has decided to fill this void. Project: Lunch-Box is a non-tied event (meaning it’s not sponsored or otherwise affiliated with any specific team or launcher). Our main goal is for the community to come together and produce the coolest packs this community has seen thus far and going forward. As well as our goal being to showcasing new and upcoming as well as already existing pack-makers by giving people a place where they can showcase their talents.</p>
      <p>What we are looking for is creativity, originality and stability in your modpacks and maps. In order to help give you the time to complete this we will be running this event throughout a period of 2 months.</p>
